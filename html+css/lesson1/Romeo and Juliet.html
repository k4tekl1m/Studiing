        <h2><b>PROLOGUE</b></h2>
   
    <div id="text">
        <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,</p>
        <p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
        <p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
        <p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
        <p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
        <p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</p>
        <p>Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows</p>
        <p>Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.</p>
        <p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</p>
        <p>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</p>
        <p>Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,</p>
        <p>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</p>
        <p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
        <p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
